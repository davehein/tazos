NAME
        taz - C compiler

SYNOPSIS
        taz FILE

DESCRIPTION
        taz compiles a C program containing a subset of the C language.  The
        compiler generates Spasm code, which can be assembled with the spasm
        utility.  taz allows the char, short and int types.  char is unsigned
        and short and int are signed.  These types can be modified with the
        signed and unsigned keywords.

        Pointers and single dimension arrays may be declared.  Global
        variables and arrays may be initialized in the declaration.  Local
        variables may not be initialized in the declaration, and an explicit
        assignment must be used to initialize them.

        taz does not support any of the pre-processor directives, such as
        #include, #define and #ifdef.  In addition, taz does not support the
        following keywords:

        enum, extern, volatile, constant, struct, typedef, switch and case.
