NAME
        tazcc - taz compiler collection

SYNOPSIS
        tazcc FILE

DESCRIPTION
        tazcc is a script file that compiles a C program into a Taz OS
        executable by running the taz, p2asm and p2link utilities.  At each
        step, tazcc will check to see if the step ran correctly before starting
        the next one.  In the final step, tazcc will link the compiled program
        with the libx.a library contained in the lib directory.
