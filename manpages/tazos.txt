NAME
        tazos - taz operating system

DESCRIPTION
        Tazos is a linux-like operating system that runs on a Parallax P2
        Propeller processor interfaced to an SD card.  It consists of a boot
        program, shell and many applications.

        The boot program resides in the Propeller boot EEPROM.  When run for
        the first time, the boot program prompts the user for the I/O pins used
        to interface to the SD card.  The boot program then starts up the shell
        program.

        Spinix maintains an area at the top of memory that contains mail boxes
        that are used to talk to the console and SD driver.

        The shell provides a user interface that accepts commands from the
        user, and executes programs that are stored on the SD card.

SEE ALSO
        For more information see the man pages on the boot program and the
        shell.
